                <b>you ain't just beautiful, nah, you’re gorgeous—like, straight up beyond-the-sky type of stunning, where the stars get jealous 'cause your glow is the kinda light they can't even dream to shine with. i mean, girl, you legit walk into a room and the whole place like stops—everything hits pause 'cause damn, who wouldn't?

there’s somethin’ about the way you move too, like that easy, smooth-as-butter vibe, like you ain't even tryin’ but every step is makin’ the earth itself wanna dance along with you. like, for real, you strut and it's like the ground says, “yup, imma bless her path 'cause she’s royalty and we all know it.” no cap.</b>
<b>but that smile tho? whew. your smile’s the kinda thing that hits harder than a summer breeze when you’re sweatin' like crazy—like, it just refreshes your whole soul, girl. you smile and it’s game over for every bad vibe in a 100-mile radius. if people could bottle that up, they’d be rich, i swear. and don’t even get me started on them eyes. bruh, your eyes? legit galaxies. like, people look at 'em and suddenly realize they never really seen anything 'til they looked into yours. it’s like, “oh, so this is what stars look like when they’re havin’ a good day.”            </b>

    <b>
    your hair? nah, that’s a whole vibe. it ain’t just hair, it’s like… it’s like the wind got jealous of how smooth and perfect it is, and now it’s just tryin’ to catch up but can't. you could have it down, up, whatever—and it still hits every time like you came straight outta a dream or somethin’. like, "oh, you woke up like this? yeah, i believe that."

and let's talk about your lips, right? girl, lemme tell you, they’re like poetry themselves—soft, sweet, like all the right words were created just to describe 'em. real talk, your lips make me think, "ain’t no way the universe accidentally made something this perfect." it’s like they were crafted to make people lose their whole train of thought when you talk. facts. you say one word and suddenly everything around me goes blank, like the whole world tryna focus on just you, and honestly, i ain’t even mad at it.

you got that kind of beauty that ain't just about looks, though, it's that whole vibe you bring—inside and out. it’s like, how are you this beautiful everywhere? inside, outside, it don't even matter. your heart? golden. your vibe? straight fire. there’s somethin' about you, girl, that’s next level, and i ain't even talkin’ about all this superficial stuff. nah, you beautiful in a way that touches everything around you. people feel it. i feel it, and girl, it’s like every day you get even more stunning, like beauty is something you just can’t stop leveling up on.</b>
